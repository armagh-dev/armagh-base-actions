Table 1 Instructions: Provide the total number of current faculty members, predoctoral trainees, and postdoctoral trainees in each
participating department/program. Faculty members may be counted more than once if they participate in a departmental as well as an
interdepartmental program(s). Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are counted only once and should be associated with a single
department or program. In brackets, indicate the number of predoctoral trainees and postdoctoral trainees who are supported by any NIH
training grant. Indicate the number of faculty members participating in this training grant application, and the numbers of predoctoral and
postdoctoral trainees with the participating faculty. In parentheses, put the number of trainees with the participating faculty who are
Kirschstein-NRSA training grant eligible (TGE). Include the number of TGE predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees who are from
underrepresented groups that fulfill the diversity requirement: TGE predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees who are underrepresented
minorities (Group A), who are individuals with disabilities (Group B), or who are individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (Group C).
Individuals may be counted in more than one of these groups if applicable. Data on Group C may not be required by the specific
instructions in the FOA to which you are responding.

List publications of representative previous predoctoral trainees and of ALL current predoctoral trainees of the proposed mentors. Only
include previous trainees over the last ten years and only trainees who would have been considered for appointment, if this program had
been supported by an NIH training grant during their period of training. Sort trainees by Mentor. For each mentor, group past trainees
separately from current trainees. Sort each group by the year of entry into the graduate program. In parenthesis, include the year the
trainee started graduate studies, and if appropriate, when they completed their training. Designate Kirschstein-NSRA training grant eligible
trainees (TGE) by an asterisk (*). List all publications of trainees resulting from their period of training in the faculty member’s laboratory or
in association with the training program, through completion of their doctoral degree regardless of when the publication actually appeared.
List abstracts only if a more complete publication has not appeared and label these clearly as abstracts. List publications followed by
abstracts in chronological order. Boldface the trainee’s name in the author list.
When citing articles that fall under the Public Access Policy, were authored or co-authored by the trainee and arose from NIH support,
provide the NIH Manuscript Submission reference number (e.g., NIHMS97531) or the PubMed Central (PMC) reference number (e.g.,

authors, indicate "PMC Journal - In Process." A list of these Journals is posted at:
http://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process_journals.htm.
Summarize these data in the body of the proposal. For example, what is the average number of papers published by trainees, how many
as first author, how many trainees graduate without any first author publication.
Rationale: This information provides an indicator of the ability of the mentor to foster trainee productivity and allows assessment of the
research quality and authorship priority of previous predoctoral trainees.

Summarize these data in the body of the proposal. For example, what is the average number of papers published by trainees, how many
first author, what has been the impact of these publications on their field of science.
Rationale: This information provides an indicator of the ability of the mentor to foster trainee productivity and allows assessment of the
research quality and authorship priority of previous postdoctoral trainees.

Table 7A Instructions: For each participating department/program for each of the past 5 years, list the following information: number(s) of
individuals who have formally applied for training; have been accepted for admission; enrolled; are still in the program; completed the
program; and left the program. In parenthesis, put the number of the trainees in each group who were Kirschstein-NRSA training grant
eligible (TGE). Where indicated, include the number of TGE trainees who were underrepresented minorities (Group A), the number of the
TGE trainees who were individuals with disabilities (Group B), and the number of the TGE trainees who were individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds (Group C). Data on Group C may not be required by the specific instructions in the FOA to which you are
responding. Do not include students admitted solely to obtain master’s degrees. For those who left the program without completing their
Instructions and Sample Data Tables

training, include the reason for leaving the program. Sort data by department/program and then by year. For programs with multiple
entering department/program trainee pools, provide totals for each year, and sums and averages.
Summarize these data in the Program Plan Section 2.3.e Trainee Candidates. Analyze the data in terms of the overall numbers of potential
trainees, their sources and enrollment trends, their eligibility for Kirschstein-NRSA support, diversity, and overall success in completing the
training program.
Rationale: These data permit the evaluation of the participating departments/programs’ abilities to recruit and retain predoctoral trainees
through the completion of their PhD requirements. The data permit separate analyses of total trainees, TGE trainees, and the diversity of
the trainees. These data are useful in determining the selectivity of the admissions process, the success of recruitment and retention of
trainees from diverse backgrounds, and the appropriate number of training positions to be awarded.

program; and left the program. In parenthesis put the number of these trainees in each group who were Kirschstein-NRSA training grant
eligible (TGE). Where indicated, include the number of the TGE trainees who were underrepresented minorities (Group A), the number of
the TGE trainees who were individuals with disabilities (Group B), and the number of the TGE trainees who were individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds (Group C). Data on Group C may not be required by the specific instructions in the FOA to which you are
responding. For those who left the program without completing their training, include the reason for leaving the program. Sort data by
Instructions and Sample Data Tables

department/program, year of application, and previous doctoral degree type of entering trainees. For programs with multiple entering
department/program trainee pools, provide totals for each year, and sums and averages.
Programs that select postdoctoral trainees exclusively from candidates who apply to academic department(s) or programs (e.g.,
Department of Hematology or Interdepartmental Program in Cancer Therapeutics), please provide data for each participating
department/program. Include only those postdoctoral applicants who could be considered candidates for the proposed training program.
Programs that select trainees exclusively from candidates who are recruited directly to the laboratories of the proposed faculty mentors
should list only those candidates who were actually in the laboratories of the faculty mentors and considered for the program. Please
indicate in a footnote which system of recruitment is used by this program. Applicants are strongly urged to contact IC staff mentioned
in the FOA for guidance on what data to include in this table.
Summarize these data in the Program Plan Section 2.3.e Trainee Candidates. Analyze the data in terms of the overall numbers of potential
trainees, their sources and trends, their eligibility for Kirschstein-NRSA support, diversity, and overall success in completing the training
program.
Rationale: These data permit evaluation of the abilities of the participating departments/programs to recruit and retain postdoctoral
trainees through the completion of their training. The data permit separate analyses of total trainees, TGE trainees, and the diversity of the
trainees. These data are useful in determining the selectivity of the admissions process, the success of recruitment and retention of
trainees from diverse backgrounds, and the appropriate number of training positions to be awarded.

Table 8A Instructions: List the qualifications and application outcomes of predoctoral applicants to each participating
department/program for the most recent year. Applicants should be listed anonymously and identified by a number in sequence, rather
than by name, to safeguard privacy. Indicate applicants who are Kirschstein-NRSA training grant eligible (TGE) with an asterisk (*). For
each applicant provide: previous institution(s) attended, degree(s) and year awarded; GPA normalized to a 4.0 scale; and GRE scores for
Verbal, Quantitative, Analytical tests, and any Subject tests if taken (and/or percentiles) or MCAT scores Verbal Reasoning, Physical
Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Writing Sample (or DAT scores if relevant). Indicate which applicants were or were not interviewed;
accepted; and enrolled. For those who declined an offer of admission, indicate the institution in which they enrolled, if this is known. For
renewal applications, indicate those applicants who have been or are currently supported by this grant. Sort applicants by
department/program and then in the following order: 1) those who enrolled; 2) those who were accepted, but did not enroll; 3) those who
were interviewed, but not offered admission; and 4) any additional applicants that would have been seriously considered for admission, if
sufficient funds were available to support them. It may be appropriate to truncate this data after the first 10-20% of those who were not
accepted. Applicants are strongly urged to contact IC staff mentioned in the FOA for guidance on what data to include in this
table.
At the bottom of the table include summary statistics: average GRE and/or MCAT/DAT scores and average GPAs of all applicants listed;
and total numbers of students interviewed, offered admission, and enrolled. Indicate the numbers in each group who were TGE. Average
GRE and/or MCAT/DAT scores and average GPAs for students who were accepted, and for those who enrolled, would also be useful to
include.
Summarize these data in the Program Plan Section 2.3.e Trainee Candidates. Analyze the data in terms of the overall numbers of potential
trainees, their previous training, and credentials.
Rationale: The data provided in this table will permit an evaluation of the quality and depth of the applicant pool. The data permit separate
analyses for TGE and non-TGE applicants. These data are useful in determining the selectivity of the admissions process, the
competitiveness of the program, and the appropriate number of training positions to be awarded.

The sample data is for Institutes that allow trainees to be appointed for less than 12 months in a given budget year. Institute policies may vary. Check with the relevant IC
specific program announcements and instructions.

Table 11 Instructions: For each year of the grant since the last competing application, list the following: 1) total number of positions
awarded in each training category and in parenthesis the number of months; 2) number of predoctoral trainees appointed and in
parenthesis the number of months of support used; and 3) number of postdoctoral trainees appointed, with entering degrees, and in
parenthesis the number of months used. Delete rows that are not relevant to the type of training support awarded. For both types of
training position, indicate the number of trainees from underrepresented groups who are appointed and in parenthesis the months of
support used. If any trainee positions were not filled, provide the reason in a footnote.

Table 12 A Instructions: List sequentially, by entering year, all trainees who were or are currently supported by this training grant. For
previous trainees, include up to the previous 10 years. For each student provide: 1) name; 2) year of entry into the training program; 3)
prior institution and degree at entry; 4) in parenthesis name of research mentor and department/program; 5) the source of support during
each year of training, e.g., this training grant, another training grant (specify), research grant, university fellowship, individual fellowship
(specify), etc.; 6) research topic; 7) degree and year awarded, and 8) for trainees who have completed the program, their current positions,
rank and/or title and institutional affiliations, and grants obtained, if any. Enter all trainees who received support from this grant including
those who did not complete the training program for any reason.
In the Program Statistics section, report: 1) the percentage of trainees entering 10 years ago and receiving support from this training grant
at some point during graduate school that received Ph.D.s or equivalent research doctoral degrees, and 2) the average time to degree for
all trainees appointed to this training grant completing Ph.D.s in the last ten years, calculated to one decimal place (e.g., 5.5 years),
excluding any officially-approved leaves of absence. In calculating these program statistics, students transferring to medical school or other
doctoral-level professional programs should be included in the entering class, but not considered to have earned a Ph.D.-equivalent
degree. Individuals transferring to or from Ph.D. programs in similar fields at other institutions should be excluded from both the entering
and graduating cohorts in calculating completion and time to degree.
Time to degree should be calculated as the period from enrollment in a doctoral degree program at the reporting institution to the conferral
of a Ph.D. or equivalent research doctoral degree, less any officially-approved leaves of absence. If a student earns a master’s degree
from the reporting institution prior to and in conjunction with fulfilling the requirements for the research doctoral degree, or an additional
doctoral degree as part of a dual-degree program (e.g., M.D./Ph.D., D.D.S/Ph.D.), time to degree should be calculated from entry into the
first degree program.
For Non-Competing Continuation Progress Reports, provide updated trainee information, reflecting new appointments and other changes
over the reporting period. Do not include data that is older than ten years.
Explain coding of source of support in a footnote. For example: TG = this training grant, RG = research grant, UF = university funds, TA=
teaching assistantships, TG2 = another training grant (e.g., Neuroscience training), F = individual fellowships (e.g. university fellow, NRSA,
NSF, foundations, etc.).
For Noncompeting Continuation Progress Reports, summarize this data under Research Training Program Plan Section 2.6.

Rationale: For renewal applications, this table provides detailed information about how predoctoral training positions are used (i.e.,
