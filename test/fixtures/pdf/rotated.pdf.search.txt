Table 4 Instructions: For each participating faculty member, list active and pending research grant and contract support from all sources
(including Federal, non-Federal, and institutional research grant and contract support) that will provide the context for research training
experiences. Exclude research training grants. If none, state "None." Include the role of the participating faculty member (PD/PI, co-
investigator, etc.) in the grant and grant title; source of support, grant number, and status (use an asterisk (*) to indicate pending sources of
support); dates of the entire project period; and the current year annual direct costs. If the source of support is part of a multiple project
grant (for example, a P01), additionally identify the PD/PI of the overall project, and provide the above information for that component of
the grant with which the faculty member is associated. For grants with major budget changes in future years such as clinical trials, include
the total direct costs of the award in parentheses. Do not list grants that have expired unless a pending continuation application has been
submitted.

Summarize these data the Program Plan Section 2.3.b Program Faculty. Analyze the data in terms of total and average grant support.
Comment on the inclusion of faculty without research grant support and explain how the research of students that may work with them
would be supported.
