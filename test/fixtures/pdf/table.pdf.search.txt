Table 1 Instructions: Provide the total number of current faculty members, predoctoral trainees, and postdoctoral trainees in each
participating department/program. Faculty members may be counted more than once if they participate in a departmental as well as an
interdepartmental program(s). Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are counted only once and should be associated with a single
department or program. In brackets, indicate the number of predoctoral trainees and postdoctoral trainees who are supported by any NIH
training grant. Indicate the number of faculty members participating in this training grant application, and the numbers of predoctoral and
postdoctoral trainees with the participating faculty. In parentheses, put the number of trainees with the participating faculty who are
Kirschstein-NRSA training grant eligible (TGE). Include the number of TGE predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees who are from
underrepresented groups that fulfill the diversity requirement: TGE predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees who are underrepresented
minorities (Group A), who are individuals with disabilities (Group B), or who are individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (Group C).
Individuals may be counted in more than one of these groups if applicable. Data on Group C may not be required by the specific
instructions in the FOA to which you are responding.
