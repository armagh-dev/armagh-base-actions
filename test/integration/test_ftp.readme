TEST FTP
INTEGRATION TEST ENVIRONMENT

The integration tests for FTP assume the existence of an active FTP server.  You must configure
an FTP server in your environment as described below, and provide the hostname and credentials
in a json configuration in this folder.

The server you configure must have a password-protected account whose base directory has the 
following subdirectories:

   *  no_access_dir owned by a different user and group
   *  read_only_dir with 500 permissions
   *  readwrite_dir with 775 permissions, empty
   
Then you should create a JSON file with a hash containing members

   'test_ftp_username' => username as a string
   'test_ftp_password' => password as a Base64-encoded string
   'test_ftp_host'     => FQDN of your ftp server as a string
